Cee-lo is a popular gambling game that uses 3 six-sided dice. This game does not have any standard rules; however, there are a few constants that are followed in all the variants of the rules. Its name is derived from the Chinese term "Sě-Wu-Liů", which means "four-five-six". The game is known by various names in America including "Four-Five-Six", "See-Low", "Dice", "Chinchirorin" and "The Three Dice Game". In China, this game is also known as “Sanliů Bŕozi", meaning "three-six dice". 

This simulator places you against the computer with a maximum bet of 5 dollars. The rules are as follows, 1-2-3 is an automatic loss, triple (or ‘trips’) or any number is a win, and 4-5-6 is a win. The dice keep rolling until two of the same number is rolled making the third your score. (2-2-4 would make 4 the score the computer has to beat)
